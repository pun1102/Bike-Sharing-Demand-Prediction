# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
This project was done during my summer training and internship program.

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle. 

Notebook file contains the code part and the explanation part.

Overview on the project:

•The objective is to predict the number of bikes went out on rent provided the data which includes various features. 
• Various python packages like numpy, pandas, seaborn were used to explore and do feature Engineering on data.
